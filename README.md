# WeatherAPI-Datafetcher

This Blazor .NET Web Application gets data from a WeatherAPI and writes said data into a postgres database. To test or use this Web App it is required to have a working postgresql database.

The already available connection string of the Web App should be able to get used without any complication if you host the database on your localhost. I would still recommend to check the connection string and maybe change it so it fits your postgresql configuration.

If you need any help setting up a postgresql read the postgresql documentation -> https://www.postgresql.org/docs/
